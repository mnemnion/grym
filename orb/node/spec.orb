* Spec


  A small test harness to exercise our fresh Node class.

*** includes

#!lua
local Grammar = require "grammar"
local Node = require "node"
local L = require "elpeg"


#/lua

** Trivial Grammar

This should succeed under all circumstances.

I'd have to guess what it will return currently. 

#!lua
local function epsilon(_ENV)
	START = "any"
	any = P(1)^1 
end 
#/lua
