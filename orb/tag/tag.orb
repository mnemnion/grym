* orb tag


This is an inner verb, in the sense that while one can call it from an outer
context it is normally invoked as the next step after =spin=ning a Doc.

=orb tag= operates the tag engine.

This turns Hashtag and Hashline classes into metadata on the AST.

This metadata is in turn used to guide the realization of subsequent steps.
