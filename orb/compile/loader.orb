* loader

This is ultimately something to add to =package.loaders=.

I need to add a bunch of database manipulation here, so it will probably also
have the parts of the compiler which write changes to the database.

#!lua
local sql = require "sqlite"
#/lua

#!lua
local Loader = {}
#/lua

#!lua
return Loader
#/lua
