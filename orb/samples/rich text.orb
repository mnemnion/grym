  We'll lead with [[a link][http://example.com]], since we can already
parse those. I'm going to add a =literal block=, and a ==double literal
block with newline==, and take it from there. 

Now let's have a ===triple literal block===, and now, let's
go for a == double literal = with equals ==.

Time to add *bold*, ***multi-bold***, and **bold * with* intermediate**.
