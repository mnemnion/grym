Grimoire intends to support (La)TeX output, and thereby physical printing.
We don't consider it especially important.  Grimoire offers few advantages
over Markdown for those exclusively concerned with prosaic contents, and 
authors who work only with prose have no special motive to adopt it.

The core use case for our weave is producing views of the Orb files of a

With this written we actually have a fairly capable system. It can invert a
