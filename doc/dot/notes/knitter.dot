  The change of name goes deeper than aesthetics.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]]

These interactive elements would be frustrating and error-prone to add without
the editing environment, parse engine, and efficient data structure to back
them.  By contrast, the pipelined approach to producing source code for 
subsequent compiliation is straightforward to implement, and provides the
foundation for writing pure C with some prayer of a good outcome.
